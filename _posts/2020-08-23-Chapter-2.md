<strong>Exercise 2.1:</strong> What are the differences between int, long, long long, and short? Between an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and a double?

{% highlight txt %}
The intergral types, int, long, long long, and short, represent
integer values of different sizes. The language guarantees that
an int will be at least as large as short, a long at least as
large as an int, and long long at least as large as long.

The signed type represents negative or positive numbers (including zero);
an unsigned type represents only values greater than or equal to zero.

The floating-point types represent single-, double-, and extended
-precision values. The standard specifies a minimum number of
significant digits. Most compilers provide more precision than the
specified minimum. Typically, floats are represented in one word
(32 bits), doubles in two words (64 bits).
